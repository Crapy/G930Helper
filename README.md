# G930Helper
This software will automatically shut down your G930 if no movement or sound was detected for 10 minutes.

This is yet to be public, just an idea at this point, expect more to come.

Currently requires:
1. Latest Logitech Gaming Software to be installed at the default location in C:\

2. Obviously a G930.

3. Exception in some antiviruses (my bitdefender did some trouble when trying to compile).
